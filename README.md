# CallsGuard
## Save yourself from unkown calls!

The receiver recognizes the phone number of the caller and checks if the same phone number exists in the database and returns a toast message with the name of the phone number holder.
At the same time he updates that the two people (the one who called and the one who called him) in the call and displays this on the app screen so I know before I call anyone if he is in the call
